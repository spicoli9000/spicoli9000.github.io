        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming …. all your BS and more…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Most people seem to have been indoctrinated to believe that BS only comes from certain places, certain sources: advertising, politics, salesmen – not true. BS is everywhere. BS is rampant. Parents are full of BS,teachers are full of BS, clergymen are full of BS, and law enforcement people are full…of…BS – this entire country. This entire country is completely full of BS, and always has been&lt;/em&gt;…” ~ George Carlin&lt;/p&gt;
